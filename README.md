# Hi! My name is Austin Grant and welcome to my [GitHub](https://github.com/austinagrant)!
I am a recent graduate from Vassar College where I majored in Computer Science and minored in French.
I was still able to explore other areas of interest such as Geography, History, Politcal Science and Philisophy.
Being wrong is starting to be more fun, and I'm starting to be wrong more often, but right about more things. The more I learn the more I know what I don't know. I am currently devouring [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague)'s youtube channel where he codes new projects in a super digestible format. 
## PROJECTS
Low-level programming and AI are my main interests right now. The chess program you see is adapted from a school project to help me learn Python and C. There is a more complex Java version that I can share with you to show my skills (I cannot post it here though) just shoot me an email @austinagrant@gmail.com. I also have made a model to predict expected donations for a non-profit and a binary classifier for an insurance company for a Kaggle competition.
A lot of my other projets are not on my Github as they are from school, but I can walk you through my thought process and show code during a zoom/interview. I would love to talk about them. Some of the projects: Compiler in OCAML (functional langauge & assembly), Song Lyric Classifier (Python, Pytorch), Low-level unix utitilies/commands (XARGS, EXEC, ect, and multithreaded programming), and a Java/Android application complete with: javadoc, use-case coverage, unit-testing, iterative stages, and class diagrams.

## About me 
I love tide-pooling (hence the octopus) and the wacky ways we all percieve the world. I just finished Other Minds, a book on octopus brain evolution and I'm currently reading Determined about (our lack??) of free will. I also love fantasy/Sci-fi books, GOT, Dune, Foundation. I would love to chat about my code, your code, or anything else you can think of.


## Programming Langauges
#### This is very honest (I think)
| Langauge | Proficiency | 
| :------: | :---------: |
| Java     | 8/10        |
| Python   | 8/10        |
| C        | 5/10        |
| OCAML    | 6/10        |
| SQL      | 5/10        |

I am most comfortable with Python and Java, having made complex programs in both. My C is coming along as a learn more difficult concepts (I have pointers down through). OCAML is a very elegent language and would love to be able to keep using it. SQL is also in my repertoire but getting rusty.
